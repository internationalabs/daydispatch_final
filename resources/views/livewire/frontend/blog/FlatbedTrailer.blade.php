                            Flatbed trailers are built tough. Most of them are constructed from sturdy steel,
                            ensuring their longevity. You can rely on these trailers to last a long time.

                                   Flatbed trailers are not very aerodynamic, which means they can be
                                    challenging to tow. This can result in slower speeds compared to other vehicles.
