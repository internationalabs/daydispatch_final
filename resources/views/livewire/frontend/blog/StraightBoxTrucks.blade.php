                                Imagine a vehicle where each axle, from the front of the cab to the back of the trailer, is
                                connected by a single frame.
                                <br />
                                That&#39;s a straight truck for you! These trucks come in different lengths and feature spacious, box-

                            <br />
                            Inside, most of these box trucks measure 96 inches in width and 96 inches in height, with a cargo
                            weight limit of up to 8,000 pounds.

                            The specific size of the box trucks your cargo needs depends on the type of loads and routes.

                            Think of them as the little siblings of traditional dry van trailers. They share similar internal
                            dimensions, making them perfect for transporting partial loads and less-than-truckload quantities
                            of dry goods.

                            From retail and consumer products to electronics, machine parts, and palletized freight, straight
                            trucks have your back.
                            <br />
                            There&#39;s a catch, though â€“ your cargo needs to be loaded from the back using a forklift, pallet
                            jack, or sheer manpower.

                            Some of these trucks come equipped with lift gates, but it&#39;s vital to communicate your
                            requirements upfront to ensure a smooth journey for your valuable cargo.

                                   One of the primary advantages of a box truck is the secure and weather-resistant storage
                                    it provides. Your precious cargo remains shielded from the elements, whether it&#39;s rain,
                                    wind, or harsh weather conditions.
                                    This protection ensures that your goods arrive at their destination in the same condition
                                    they left.

                                    It&#39;s a clever idea to adorn their sides and doors with your business banners and decals.
                                    This transforms your box truck into a moving advertisement, promoting your brand far

                                    Box trucks eliminate the need for trailers, streamlining deliveries and ensuring clients
