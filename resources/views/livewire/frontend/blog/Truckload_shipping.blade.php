                            Partial truckload shipping is a smart choice for those with sizable shipments that don&#39;t require a

                                Partial truckload shipping is a smart choice for those with sizable shipments that don&#39;t require a
                                full truckload trailer.
                                <br />
                                It falls in between less than truckload (LTL) and full truckload options and usually involves
                                shipments over 5,000 pounds or six or more pallets.
                                <br />
                                What makes partial truckload special is that it doesn&#39;t need a freight class to secure a rate.
                                This means fewer complications and faster transit times. Some people call it &quot;volume LTL&quot;
                                because it&#39;s like LTL, but for larger shipments.

                           Here&#39;s why you might want to consider partial truckload shipping:

                               One Truck, Less Handling:
                           </strong>
                           Your goods stay on one truck during the entire journey. This
                            results in fewer handling steps, making it faster than LTL, where your freight might move
                            between multiple trucks.

                            No Freight Class Worries:
                        </strong>
                        <p>
                            With partial truckload, you don&#39;t need to fuss over freight
                            class. This means you won&#39;t get hit with extra charges if you make a mistake.
                        </p>
                        <br />

                        <p>
                            Less handling means a lower risk of damage. This makes
                            partial truckload ideal for delicate or fragile items that could get banged up during
                            loading and unloading.

                                    If your shipment is large but not particularly heavy, partial
                                    truckload can be more cost-effective than LTL. LTL often charges based on freight class,
                                    which can be costly for items taking up a lot of space but not weighing much.

                            While partial truckload offers benefits for larger and heavier loads, LTL is a versatile option
                            suitable for a wide range of shipments, including those with varying sizes and density. Both
                            methods have their own advantages and are tailored to different shipping requirements.

                                        Ideal for delicate or weather-sensitive loads, as they provide a closed box for
                                        protection against external weather conditions.

                                    Suitable for irregularly shaped loads, those requiring top or side loading, or
                                    loads that don&#39;t need a closed space. Perfect for a variety of cargo types.
